# JS-Fundamentals

This project contains simple JavaScript scripts demonstrating:

- Variable declarations with `const` and `let`
- Basic control structures (if/else, loops)
- Command-line arguments (`process.argv`)
- Functions and operators
- Type conversion and basic error handling

Each file is a standalone script that can be run with:

```bash
node filename.js
